  1) Checkout on the new branch
  1) Create a new file, such as «may.be»
  1) Stage and commit properly
  1) Type `git log` 
  1) Checkout on master and type `git log` 
  1) Push the «master» branch on Github
  1) From master, push the other branch
  1) Go see your pushes on Github

Now it's time to merge your branch through Github!!


Merging On Github

  1) Find the `compare and pull request` button (either on the first page or in the branch tab)
  1) Click on the button to start merging
  1) Explore the option, try to add or change things
  1) Add comments, title, etc.
  1) Merge your branch and delete it
